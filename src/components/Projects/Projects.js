              description="Built from scratch in ANSI C, my buffer reserves memory cleanly and also frees memory cleanly aswell. The buffer can take an input file along with the mode. The mode determines how the memory will be managed to read the type of file. F being fixed sized of memory, M being multiplicative mode where memory capacity is multiplied when needed, and A for additive which adds on to the memory when needed. The buffer byitself is not very useful as it just takes data and reserves memory but doesnt do anything with the data. It was a good learning experience to understanding how compilers work."

The scanner makes our compiler useful in terms that something is being done with the input from the buffer although we cannot see our right and wrong lines."
